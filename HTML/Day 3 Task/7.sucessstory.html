    <p>Hariharan is one of the most famous names in the entrepreneurial community. His story is one of the most inspiring success stories in the world. Today, everyone knows about his company Apple but no one actually believed such a technology could be created at that time. Steve Jobs was a visionary who believed in himself and decided to give everything towards building his company. He was adopted by a working-class couple at the time of his birth. Steve, being a born genius, developed a taste for machines and computers very early in his life. However, if we look at Steve Jobs’s education, formal education soon started to bore him. Although, he went off to college but quit only after the first semester. He then took up a job at Atari from where he saved up some money and traveled to India. He stayed there for spiritual purposes and returned home after 7 months as a Buddhist and led a simple life. However, soon after that, he started working on a computer project with Steve Wozniak and they created their first apple product in a garage. This is how the largest IT company in the world was built. Steve Jobs has created a legacy today.</p>
